## 🤖 About This Project

### 🎨 Design & Aesthetic
I designed this website with the help of AI to be a dynamic and engaging introduction to my work.  
It’s built with a modern, **cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic** to reflect my passion for cutting-edge technology, while maintaining a clean and professional structure.  

### 🛠️ Development Process
It involved carefully prompting AI and overlooking every piece of code to ensure the website is **bug-free** and **robust**.  

### 🌐 Vision & Belief

Instead, **humans will be replaced by AI-powered humans**.
