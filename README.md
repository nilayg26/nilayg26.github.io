## About This Project

This portfolio was designed to be a dynamic and engaging introduction to my work for recruiters, collaborators, and fellow developers. It's built with a modern, cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic to reflect my passion for cutting-edge technology, while maintaining a clean and professional structure. The entire site is a single, responsive page, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

## Key Features

-   **Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts perfectly to desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
-   **Interactive Skills Terminal:** An animated "hacker terminal" types out my technical skills for a unique visual experience.
-   **Smooth Scrolling & Animations:** Subtle fade-in animations and smooth navigation provide a polished user experience.
-   **Project Showcase:** A dedicated section to highlight my key projects with descriptions and links.
-   **Direct Resume Download:** A convenient "Download Resume" button in the contact section.

## Tech Stack

This project was built from the ground up using modern web technologies:

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first, responsive, and highly customizable design.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** To power the interactive elements like the mobile menu and the skills terminal animation.
